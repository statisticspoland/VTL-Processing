_VTL Processing_ is a .NET Core library for translation of validation and transformation rules written in the VTL language (see https://sdmx.org/?page_id=5096).
The first translation target language available will be T-SQL (Microsoft SQL Server).

It is still work in progress.
However we aim at full VTL 2.0 specs coverage.
