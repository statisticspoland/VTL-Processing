=== What is VTL Processing

VTL Processing is a .NET Core library for translating VTL expressions into various target languages. The generated code can be then executed in a data processing environment to perform data validation or transformation. The library is DI-friendly and comes with built in support for .NET IOC container. 

=== Basic architecture

The VTL processing consists of several pieces: 

* Core library
* translation target libraries
* CLI application 
* REST translation service

[Core]
[Target.Tsql]

[Cli]
[Your application]

[Target.Tsql] -> [Core]
[Service] --> [Core]
[Cli] --> [Core]
[Your application] -> [Core]

[Service] --> [Target.Tsql]
[Cli] --> [Target.Tsql]
[Your application] -> [Target.Tsql]

[Your application] -> [Service]

The translation process has been divided into three stages, according to the classical compiler architecture:

Front End :: Performs the analysis of the input VTL code and generates an intermediate representation for further processing.
Middle End :: Type inference and code optimizations takes place in this phase. 
Back End :: Generates output code of the translation target language.

file vtl
rectangle "\nFront end\n" as fe
rectangle "\nMiddle end\n" as me
rectangle "\nBack end\n" as be
file output

vtl -> fe
fe -> me
me -> be
be -> output
----

Front-end and Middle-end parts of the translator are packaged in the *StatisticsPoland.VtlProcessing.Core* library. Code generation logic (back-end) has been placed in separate targeting packages, one for each target language. VTL processing comes with the following targets:

StatisticsPoland.VtlProcessing.Target.Tsql :: Produces a Transact SQL code executable under Sql Server databases.
StatisticsPoland.VtlProcessing.Target.PlantUml :: Generates a PlantUML diagram of the provided intermediate representation. Helpful for debugging purposes.

VTL Processing also comes with a simple command line application to perform translation without the need to build your own app.

=== Example translation

.Source VTL code
----
DS_r := DS_1 + DS_2
----

.Translated T-SQL code
----
IF OBJECT_ID (N'tempdb..#DS_r', N'U') IS NOT NULL
DROP TABLE #DS_r

SELECT * INTO #DS_r FROM (
SELECT
ds1.Id_1,
ds1.Id_2,
ds1.Me_1 + ds2.Me_1 AS Me_1,
ds1.Me_2 + ds2.Me_2 AS Me_2
FROM DS_1 AS ds1 
INNER JOIN DS_2 AS ds2 
ON
ds1.Id_1 = ds2.Id_1 AND
ds1.Id_2 = ds2.Id_2 
) AS t
----

=== Additional metadata requirements

In order to perform the translation, you need to provide the model of the data, your VTL expressions work with. The above example translation wouldn't be possible without the knowledge of _DS_r_ structure.

[plantuml]
----
file vtl
file sql
rectangle translator
rectangle "data model" as model

vtl --> translator
model --> translator
translator --> sql
